# So_Long Project

## Overview

Welcome to the So_Long project! This is a small 2D game built as part of a learning exercise in computer graphics programming. The game is based on the concept of collecting items within a confined space while avoiding obstacles and navigating through a maze-like environment.

## Features

- **2D Graphics**: Rendered using the MiniLibX library, providing a simple yet powerful interface for 2D graphics in C.
- **Map Parsing**: Dynamic game maps created from configuration files, allowing for customizable levels.
- **Collision Detection**: Basic collision handling to manage interactions between the player and the game environment.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Utilizes efficient algorithms to manage rendering and updates, ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Make (for building the project)
- MiniLibX
